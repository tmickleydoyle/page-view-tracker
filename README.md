# Enhanced Page View Event Generator

This code demonstrates how to process a large number of events (2.5 million) efficiently using Web Workers in a React application. It simulates generating and analyzing page view events for two different layout designs.

## What the Code Does

1. **Event Generation**: 
   - Uses a Web Worker to generate 2.5 million synthetic page view events.
   - Each event includes details like event ID, user ID, timestamp, page URL, layout design, and user experience.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Simulates two layout designs: "Design Static Layout" and "Design Dynamic Layout".
   - Tracks positive and negative user experiences for each design.
   - Processes events in batches of 1000 to maintain performance.

3. **Real-time Analysis**:
   - Calculates and updates statistics for each layout design as events are generated.
   - Determines a "winner" based on which design has a 5% or greater advantage in positive experiences.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Displays a progress bar showing the number of events processed.
   - Shows real-time statistics for each layout design.
   - Provides start, stop, and reset controls for the event generation process.
   - Displays a sample event for reference.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Utilizes a Web Worker to perform the event generation and processing off the main thread.
   - Uses a BroadcastChannel for communication between the worker and the main thread.
   - Updates the UI efficiently using React hooks and state management.

## Key Components

- `EnhancedPageViewGeneratorComponent`: The main React component that renders the UI and manages the event generation process.
- Web Worker: Handles the event generation and initial processing to avoid blocking the main thread.
- BroadcastChannel: Facilitates communication between the Web Worker and the main thread.

This code serves as a demonstration of handling large-scale data processing tasks in a web application while maintaining a responsive user interface.
